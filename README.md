Description:

ðŸ¦  Breast Cancer Data Set

This dataset contains the characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer. The dataset contains a unique ID for each patient, the type of cancer (diagnosis), the visual characteristics of the cancer and the average values of these characteristics.

ðŸ“š The main features of the dataset are as follows:

id: Represents a unique ID of each patient.
diagnosis: Indicates the type of cancer. This property can take the values "M" (Malignant - Benign) or "B" (Benign - Malignant).
radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean: Represents the mean values of the cancer's visual characteristics.
There are also several categorical features where patients in the dataset are labeled with numerical values. You can examine them in the Chart area.

Other features contain specific ranges of average values of the features of the cancer image:

radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean
Each of these features is mapped to a table containing the number of values in a given range. You can examine the Chart Tables
